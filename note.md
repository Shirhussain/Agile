Agile

in user story have a certain way of bing written. like this format:
I need to ----> what? 
so that   ---> why?   the value and teh reasone you are doing that 

for example as a developer: i need to create a facebook login so that it's easyer for youser to login to the site.

but what i recommand you to do is start with a verb or action somthing you need to do,
like microsoft360 or planner which start with doing, something need to do which 
delver a value to the end user.	


in Aginle kanban board we have five part:

1-Todo     2-Doging      3-QA        4-Done            5-Parking Lot/Idea


QA it means taht quality of assurance, it dosn't mean that every task should go to QA but it's just for those which we wanna evaluate.
for example if a developer done his/her task to the tester should test and project manager should see the resalut and check we use QA
